							<p>In the fall of 1976, if all goes well, anglers and sportsmen in Ward Seven will be able to go over to
								the Don River and fish for salmon. </p>

							<p>In a daring experiment, the Ministry of Natural Resources dumped 50,000 year-and-a-half old salmon into
								the Don River, up near the Ontario Science Centre, last month. </p>

							<p>Those young salmon are at the life stage where they are possessed with the urge to migrate down-stream
								to the ocean, or in this case, Lake Ontario. </p>

							<p>If the young fish responded as expected, they did not linger in the Don, but swam steadily down-stream
								searching for the lake. And if they encountered any pollution which was not overly toxic, the
								expectation was that they would &#8220;hold their nose and swim right through&#8221;.</p>

							<p>It is also expected that the mouth of the Don River would probably pose a few directional problems for
								the fish. They might make some wrong turns but hopefully they would eventually reach the lake. </p>

							<p>During the 1850&#8217;s, in Toronto&#8217;s past, the Don River was famous for its salmon runs.
								&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with returning the river to the fish? That&#8217;s what rivers are for, not
								for sewage disposal,&#8221; stated Al Wainio, chief biologist for the Ministry. </p>

							<p>The life cycle of the salmon is three years and at that time they return to their point of origin to
								spawn. &#8220;When these salmon return, if they do, in the fall of 1976, they will tell us whether or
								not the Don is ready for salmon stocking.&#8221;</p>
