								And Ahbenoojeyug Inc. is a Ward Seven Organization that since 1972 has been providing services for
								Native children in the City of Toronto.
							</p>

							<p>
								Some of the services the organization provides are:

								 &bull; An after-school program offering cultural, recreational, social and educational activities.<br>
								 &bull; A Native Big Brother/Big Sister program designed for children aged 5 to 16 from single-parent
								families.<br>
								 &bull; An all-day summer program which emphasizes cultural events such as visits to nearby reserves.<br>
								 &bull; An educational program which supplies tutors to children with academic difficulties. <br>
								 &bull; A family worker program offering a liaison service with families, schools, courts and social agencies.
							</p>

							<p>Since its creation, the organization has been located at 315 Dundas East but recently has moved to
								Eastdale Secondary school, 701 Gerrard East. At their new home, they have the use of a kitchen,
								cafeteria and recreational facilities.</p>

							<p>To acquaint interested people with their new quarters, they will be holding an Open-House during the
								week of May 26-30. between 6 AND 8 p.m.</p>

							<p>To raise funds for their continued operation Ahbenoojeyug Inc. is planning Ward Seven&#8217;s first
								walkathon. Called &#8220;Moccasin Miles&#8221;, it will be held June 7, starting at 7:30 a.m.</p>

							<p>The route of the Walkathon will take it up Broadview to O&#8217;Connor Drive to Victoria Park and from
								there south to Queen, and then west on Queen back to Broadview and up to the starting point at Riverdale
								Park. There will be appropriate checkpoints and refreshment stations scattered along the route.</p>

							<p>Both sponsors and walkers are still needed for the walkathon, and for more information, phone 364-8775.
